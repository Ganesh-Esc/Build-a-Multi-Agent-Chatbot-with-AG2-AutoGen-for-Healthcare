**MultiAgent Healthcare Chatbot with AG2**
**Objective**: Build collaborative AI agents for medical treatment recommendations using AutoGen framework
**Skills Covered**: Multi-agent collaboration, healthcare domain application, and AutoGen coordination

AutoMed is not just an ordinary chatbot—it’s a multi-agent AI system powered by AG2 (AutoGen), designed to simulate expert medical consultation through intelligent collaboration. Instead of relying on a single AI agent, AutoMed orchestrates multiple specialized agents, each dedicated to a specific task, ensuring comprehensive, accurate, and real-time medical guidance. By leveraging AutoGen’s multi-agent capabilities, AutoMed mimics the behavior of a real medical team, where different AI agents collaborate to analyze symptoms, suggest treatments, fetch real-time medical data, and provide follow-up care.

With its adaptive intelligence and multi-agent communication, AutoMed delivers human-like, context-aware conversations that go beyond basic symptom checkers. Unlike conventional AI chatbots that provide one-size-fits-all responses, AutoMed's specialized agents work together to deliver precise, tailored recommendations based on the user’s health history and real-time input. This results in a more interactive, intelligent, and reliable medical consultation experience.
